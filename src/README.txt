The story begins in a faraway cherry tree filled forest. It was once home to Blossom Village,
but abandoned due to the Greater-Tiered-War. That war started here, in this village, and you
are an investigator, part of a team of scientists who are attempting to find out what happened to
devastate the land, and the World on top of it. Almost everywhere is covered in a dark, black haze,
except for the old Blossom Village and a few other places. You alone are trying to find out
the mystery behind these few locations, starting with the Blossom Village and heading on an adventure
to Partridge Village, CandleWood Camp, Crystal Cottages and Star-Light Islands.
